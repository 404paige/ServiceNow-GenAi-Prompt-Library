This repository is an entry point to submit prompts directly from this GitHub repo, so that they can appear at https://devlink.sn/PromptLibrary

The Prompt Library itself, is a community-driven hub for ServiceNow professionals to gather Generative AI prompts that we use to make our lives easier. **This is not a Now Assist product**. These are prompts we use inside GenAi Service Providers like ChatGPT, Claude Anthropic, or Google Gemini.

## Contributing process

### Think of a prompt

Have a prompt you use often in your day-to-day work as a ServiceNow professional?

Examples:
- Prompts that write emails for you
- Prompts that generate very specific code snippets
- Prompts that help you create documentation
- Prompts that help you tailor providers like ChatGPT to your ServiceNow experience specifically
- Etc.

That's what we're looking for! If you want examples, you can see the top-voted ones at the library at this link: https://communityresources.service-now.com/ai?id=library&display=10&sort=true
