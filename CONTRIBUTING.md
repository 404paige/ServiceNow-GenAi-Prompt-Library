# Contributing

## General requirements

- Pull requests should be **only** to add or modify files inside the `Prompts` folder.
- The filename **must** be a description of what the prompt does.
- Filenames should not have special characters that are not allowed on normal file systems (eg. do not put ! in the file name).
- No low-effort submissions.
  - example of low-effort: "Generate discussion topics about ServiceNow"
  - example of good-effort: including an example of what you are looking for, giving context of what this will be used for, giving a goal with the prompt, adding what kind of audience would be benefitting from this, etc.

## Recommendations

Need some guidance? The RISEN framework helps structure tasks for generative AI into actionable steps:

- **R** — Role: Define the AI's role. (e.g., "Act as an agile coach.")
- **I** — Instructions: Provide clear instructions. (e.g., "Write a guide on crafting a good agile development story.")
- **S** — Steps: Outline specific steps. (e.g., "Start with a user persona, describe the user's goal, list the tasks to achieve the goal, and define the acceptance criteria.")
- **E** — End goal: State the goal and audience. (e.g., "Help team members understand how to write clear and effective agile stories.")
- **N** — Narrowing: Add constraints. (e.g., "Max 800 words, avoid technical jargon, use practical examples.")
